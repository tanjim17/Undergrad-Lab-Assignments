### xv6 Assignments
These two assignments were based on xv6 which is a teaching OS developed in MIT. Clone [this](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public) repo and apply the patch files separately.

Alternatively, you can clone [this](https://github.com/tanjim17/tanjim-xv6) repo which already contains the merged modifications.
